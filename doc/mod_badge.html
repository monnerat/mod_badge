      <h1>mod_badge</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Dynamic redirection and authentication using an encrypted URI
         path component.</p>
      <h2>When to use it</h2>
      <p>When a particular site has to give access to assigned subtrees to
         different users, all non-badge solutions involve heavy configuration
         changes such as (for each user):
         <ul>
         <li>Use mod_user and create a Unix user</li>
         <li>Create a specific directory, update authentication database and
             Apache configuration accordingly, then reload server
             configuration.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>If the user count is high and/or new users occur frequently, these
            operations can quickly load the administrator tasks and
            Apache configuration files.<p>
         <p>The solution to this problem is <b>mod_badge</b>: this module
            allows an URL to contain a badge giving access to a specific
            subtree during a defined period of time and containing its own
            authentication parameters (such as a pass in a theme park, for
            example). Since it is encrypted, the badge owner is not able to
            decode it to gain direct access to the underlying subtree.</p>
         <p>It is much easier to generate a badge for a new user than
            to create the specific configuration and authentication
            parameters that will be needed without mod_badge.</p>
         <h2>How does it work</h2>
         <p>Assuming an URL containing a badge is of the form:</p>
         <pre>
             <i>scheme</i>://<i>server</i>/<i>path-prefix</i>/<i>badge</i>/<i>path-info</i>
         </pre>
         <p>mod_badge maps it internally to:
         <pre>
             <i>scheme</i>://<i>badge-user</i>:<i>badge-password</i>@<i>server</i>/<i>badge-path-prefix</i>/<i>path-info</i>
         </pre>
         <p>where <i>badge-user</i>, <i>badge-password</i> and <i>badge-path-prefix</i>
            are extracted from the badge.</p>
         <p>This is only an URL mapping, not a redirection: in particular, the client never
            receives information about the translated URL.</p>
         <p>The badge itself is an URL path component consisting in a modified base64
            string (to accomodate URL syntax) containing the encrypted specific parameters.</p>
         <h2>Directives</h2>
         <h3>BadgeMap</h3>
         <p>Description: Define a badge path and associated cryptographic key.</p>
         <p>Syntax: BadgeMap <i>URL-path</i> <i>SSL-key-or-certificate-file</i></p>
         <p>Context: server config, virtual host, location</p>
         <p>Components of this URL may be badges encrypted with the given key.<br />
         The <i>SSL-key-or-certificate-file</i> may contain a private key, a
         public key or a certificate. The key is used both for encryption and
         decryption.</p>
         <p>More than one BadgeMap directive may be specified for the same
         <i>URL-path</i>: this allows to use alternative keys for badges within
         the same path.
         <h3>BadgeKeepAuth</h3>
         <p>Description: Specifies whether any prior authorization (either for the client
            or from a previous badge or from an SSL certificate, etc) should
            be overriden by the authorization stored in the badge (off) or not (on).</p>
         <p>Context: server config, virtual host, location</p>
         <p>Syntax: BadgeKeepAuth off|on</p>
         <p>Default: off</p>
         <h2>handlers</h2>
         <p>All handlers of this module may only be used inside &lt;Location&gt;
            or &lt;LocationMatch&gt; sections.<p>
         <h3>badge-factory</h3>
         <p>This handler allows the generation of new badges. It starts by
            requesting the following parameters:
            <ul>
                <li>The cryptographic key to use. To be chosen among configured files.</li>
                <li>The replacement path prefix: the target URL will be forged by
                appending the post-badge part of the original URL to that prefix.</li>
                <li>The badge validity start date and time.</li>
                <li>The badge validity end date and time.</li>
                <li>The target authentication user.</li>
                <li>The target authentication password.</li>
            </ul>
            After clicking the "Generate" button, a corresponding badge is displayed.</p>
            <p>Since this allows to create new badges, the access of this handler's
            location must be restricted to badge administrators.</p>
         <h3>badge-decoder</h3>
         <p>The badge-decoder handler decodes a given badge and shows its content.</p>
         <p>It is however not possible to decode a badge if the key used for
            its encryption is not listed in some configured BadgeMap directive.</p>
         <p>Since this handler reveals badge contents in clear form, its location
            should be strongly restricted to badge administrator's access only.</p>
         <h2>A typical mod_badge configuration</h2>
         <h3>Apache configuration example</h3>
         <pre>
         BadgeMap       /badge          /etc/pki/tls/certs/badgecert.crt
         Alias          /download       /var/download
         
         &lt;Directory /var/download>
                 AuthType        Basic
                 AuthName        "Download area"
                 AuthUserFile    /etc/httpd/download_passwords
                 Require         valid-user
         &lt;/Directory>
         
         &lt;Location /badge-factory>
                 SetHandler      badge-factory
                 AuthType        Basic
                 AuthName        "Download area"
                 AuthUserFile    /etc/httpd/download_passwords
                 Require         user badgeadmin
         &lt;Location>
         </pre>
         <p>For our example, let's assume file /etc/httpd/download_passwords defines
            user "badgeadmin" with password "pwd1" and user "badged" with password "pwd2".</p>
         <p>When a new user needs some private download, create its private directory
            (lets call it /var/download/thisnewuser) and store whatever should be
            accessible to him. Then generate a badge from page at /badge-factory, logging-in as
            "badgeadmin" with password "pwd1":
            <ul>
               <li>Key file: /etc/pki/tls/certs/badgecert.crt</li>
               <li>Replacement path prefix: /download/thisnewuser</li>
               <li>User: badged</li>
               <li>Password: pwd2</li>
            </ul>
            Set the validity limits as desired.</p>
         <p>Note: never tell the badge user/password to someone who must have only
            badged limited access</p>
         <p>The generated badge (a base64-like string) may then be used to form an URL
            by appending it to the proper mapping URL-path (/badge in our example). This
            URL can then be transmitted to our new user: through this link, he then
            will have access to its private subtree without having to authenticate.</p>
         <p>Although resulting in long URLs and of little usefulness, it is possible to
            have more than one badge (up to the configured redirection limit) in
            a single URL.</p>
